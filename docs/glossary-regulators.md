# Glossary (For Regulators & Executives)

---

## Accountability

The ability to clearly demonstrate **who approved the rules** under which an automated decision was made and **why the system was allowed to act**.
Accountability ensures decisions can be reviewed, challenged, and defended.

---

## Admissible

A request is admissible when it complies with all predefined rules and is permitted to proceed.
This provides a clear boundary between allowed and prohibited automated actions.

---

## Audit Artifact

A formal record that documents:

- which rules applied
- which decision was made
- and why it was allowed or restricted

Audit artifacts enable compliance reviews, investigations, and legal defense.

---

## Bias

Any factor that influences how a decision is made.
Bias is unavoidable; governance determines whether it is **explicit, controlled, and reviewable**.

---

## Bias Contract

A formal declaration of **which decision factors are allowed or prohibited** before an automated system operates.
Bias Contracts function as enforceable policy, not guidance.

---

## Covenant

A governance system that enforces Bias Contracts by controlling whether automated decisions may occur.
Covenant is designed to support compliance, auditability, and risk management.

---

## Decision

Any automated output that may affect individuals, finances, eligibility, or access.
This includes recommendations, rankings, approvals, denials, or classifications.

---

## Denylisted Signal

A category of information that an automated system is not permitted to use.
If such information appears, it is explicitly removed to prevent improper influence.

---

## Deterministic

A property of a system where identical inputs and rules always lead to the same outcome.
Determinism is required for reliable audits and regulatory review.

---

## Ex-ante

Controls applied **before** an automated decision is made.
Ex-ante governance prevents prohibited decisions rather than responding after harm occurs.

---

## Fairness

A characteristic of outcomes that may vary by context and definition.
Governance focuses on **explicit responsibility for decisions**, not guarantees of fairness.

---

## Forbidden Intent

A category of purpose or use that an automated system is not allowed to serve.
This prevents misuse regardless of how requests are phrased.

---

## Forbidden Operation

A class of decision-making behavior that is prohibited under all circumstances.
These rules prevent entire categories of risk from entering the system.

---

## Governance

The framework of enforceable rules that constrain automated systems, even when business or technical incentives push otherwise.
Governance ensures that risk tolerance is set intentionally.

---

## Plausible Deniability

The ability to claim that a harmful outcome was unintended or unforeseeable.
Explicit governance eliminates plausible deniability by requiring prior approval of decision rules.

---

## Postcheck

A control applied after an automated system produces output.
Postchecks ensure outputs comply with declared constraints and do not introduce prohibited factors.

---

## Precheck

A mandatory control that determines whether an automated decision is allowed to occur at all.
Precheck is the primary mechanism for preventing unacceptable decisions.

---

## Redaction

The visible removal of prohibited information from outputs.
Redaction ensures enforcement actions are observable and auditable.

---

## Refusal

A governed outcome in which the system intentionally does not produce a decision.
Refusal is a compliance feature, not a failure.

---

## Transparency

The ability to clearly explain:

- which rules governed a decision
- how they were applied
- and where responsibility lies

Transparency supports trust, oversight, and regulatory confidence.

# Executive takeaway

> **This governance model does not promise perfect outcomes.
> It guarantees that automated decisions only occur under explicitly approved rules, with clear accountability.**
