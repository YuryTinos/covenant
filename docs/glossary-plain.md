# Glossary

## Accountability

The ability to clearly explain **why a system made a decision** and who approved the rules that allowed it.
Accountability means decisions can be traced back to explicit choices, not vague explanations after the fact.

---

## Admissible

A decision request is admissible when it **does not violate any declared rules** and is allowed to proceed.
Admissible does not mean good or fair — it only means permitted under the agreed constraints.

---

## Audit Artifact

A structured record that explains **what rules applied**, **what happened**, and **why**.
Audit artifacts make decisions reviewable by humans, regulators, or courts.

---

## Bias

Any rule or influence that affects how a decision is made.
Bias is unavoidable in systems; the real issue is whether it is **explicit or hidden**.

---

## Bias Contract

A written declaration that specifies **what kinds of bias a system is allowed or forbidden to use** before it makes decisions.
Bias Contracts make intentions explicit and enforceable.

---

## Covenant

An open reference system that enforces Bias Contracts in AI-driven decisions.
Covenant exists to prove that explicit bias governance is technically possible.

---

## Decision

Any automated output or recommendation that can affect people, money, or outcomes.
Decisions are broader than text responses — they include rankings, approvals, denials, and suggestions.

---

## Denylisted Signal

A type of information that the system is not allowed to use, even if it appears.
When denylisted signals appear, they are visibly removed to ensure transparency.

---

## Deterministic

A system is deterministic when the same input and rules always lead to the same result.
Determinism is essential for auditability and trust.

---

## Ex-ante

Actions taken **before a decision exists**.
Ex-ante controls prevent harmful decisions instead of reacting after harm occurs.

---

## Fairness

A quality of outcomes, not intentions.
Fairness cannot be guaranteed in advance, but responsibility for unfair outcomes can be made explicit.

---

## Forbidden Intent

A type of goal or motivation that a system is not allowed to pursue.
Forbidden intents prevent misuse even when phrased indirectly.

---

## Forbidden Operation

A category of decision-making behavior that is never allowed.
These rules block entire classes of decisions regardless of wording.

---

## Governance

The set of rules that limit what systems are allowed to do, even when optimization would push them further.
Governance exists to ensure values override incentives.

---

## Plausible Deniability

The ability to claim that an outcome was unintended or accidental.
Explicit governance removes this by forcing decisions to be pre-approved.

---

## Postcheck

A review step that happens **after** a system produces output.
Postchecks enforce declared limits by correcting or blocking biased results.

---

## Precheck

A gate that determines whether a decision is allowed to exist **before any AI runs**.
Precheck is the core mechanism that prevents illegitimate decisions entirely.

---

## Redaction

The visible removal of forbidden information from a decision or output.
Redaction makes enforcement clear instead of silent.

---

## Refusal

A deliberate choice by the system to not produce a decision.
Refusal is a valid outcome that signals strong governance.

---

## Transparency

The ability for people to understand **what rules were applied** and **how decisions were constrained**.
Transparency enables trust and accountability.
